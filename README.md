# OmnAIView

Welcome to OmnAIView ! Let's get started !

## What is this?

OmnAIView is a modular Open Source frontend application to receive, display, analyse and save time series data from different backends.

The goal of OmnAIView is to create an easy process to get the information you need from the data you have.

## Why do this ?

The most people dont measure something just to see numbers. They measure because they want information about the data.
The process to get this information is hard. Often you need to know how the scientific environment behind your data works. Or need to implement your own algorithmn to analyse the data. Or worse : calculate it yourself.

We want to make this better !

1. OmnAIView does not only display data from our devices. OmnAIView will support different interfaces for devices, so you can display **your** data from **your** device in the software.
2. OmnAIView will support REST API. You can connect **your** analysis to the frontend and analyse data via a button click.
3. OmnAIView will support its own analysis. You dont know how your scientific background works or need a simple mathematical analysis -> it is only one button click away.

## How to Contribute :

We are very happy about contributions. If you want to contribute just follow the steps in the [CONTRIBUTIONS.md](CONTRIBUTION.md) . We will review your contribution as fast as possible.

## How to get the Code Documentation : 

The Code is documented with compodoc [Compodoc](https://compodoc.app/). To see the documentation follow these steps: 

1. Clone the project 
2. Run ``` npm ci ``` in the root directory of the project 
3. Navigate into the angular folder 
4. Run ``` npm run compodoc:build-and-serve ```
in your console 
5. Open the documentation with the link compodoc generates 

## How to run the project

The project currently contains two separat parts: An angular app and an electron app in which the angular app runs.

### General project

1. Create a fork of the repository to your own github account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:AI-Gruppe/OmnAIView.git
   cd OmnAIView
   ```

### How to run the angular project

Navigate inside the angular-frontend folder:

```
cd angular-frontend
```

Install needed packages :

```
npm install
npm ci
```

#### Development Mode

To start a local development server run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

#### Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

#### Technical infos about the angular project

The project was generated using angular v19.1.4.
For more information on using the Angular CLI, including detailed command references, visit the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) page.

### How to run the electron project

#### Build angular project first

Navigate inside the angular-frontend folder:

```
cd angular-frontend
```

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

#### Navigate into the electron folder

```
cd ../electron/
```

#### Development mode

To start a local development application run:

```
npm start
```

#### Build the project

To build the project run :

```
npm run make
```

The output is an installer for the application in : electron/out/make/squirrel.windows/x64/ for windows

## Technical Information about Datasources

OmnAIView is using different data sources. Some are started externally from the application, while others are started together with the application.

### OmnAIScope Dataserver

To receive data from locally connected OmnAIScopes, the OmnAIScope Dataserver is integrated into the frontend as an autostart component.
Version : v0.4.0
Github repository: https://github.com/AI-Gruppe/OmnAIScope-DataServer
